        <p>
          The Smart Parking System is an innovative Oracle-based application
          developed using Java to optimize urban parking management. This system
          leverages sensors and real-time data to track parking space
          availability, reduce congestion, and guide drivers to the nearest
          available spot through a mobile interface. The solution incorporates
          automated billing, reservation of parking slots, and an intuitive
          admin panel for facility managers. By streamlining the parking
          process, it enhances the user experience, minimizes time spent
          searching for parking, and contributes to smarter city infrastructure.
